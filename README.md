# Hire From Underrepresented Groups

A list of organizations to submit your job posting.
Inspired by [Speakers Who Want A Platform](https://github.com/iheanyi/speakers-who-want-a-platform).

## Why this matters
"They don't apply. There just aren't enough qualified applicants. We can't lower our bar."

A lot of hiring managers and team leads seem to believe that the reason that their teams don't have more people from underrepresented groups is because they don't apply, or that there aren't enough qualified applicants out there. This is simply _not true_. On the other hand, a lot of companies _want_ to make their teams more representative of the world that we live in, but don't know where to start when it comes to making their hiring process more diverse and inclusive. This means making a concerted effort to reach out to underrepresented communities. This list is an attempt at solving this problem. 

For more reasons on why this matters, check out Sarah Mei's [thread](https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/788420315290345472) on hiring from underrepresented groups.

## Adding an organization
Anyone who manages a social media network or professional organization that **explicitly serves an underrepresented group in tech** is welcome to add that group to here. Please _do not_ include broad job boards like StackOverflow or LinkedIn, or groups that aren't aimed towards an underrepresented group in particular.

If you'd like to add an organization (or many!), check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/vaidehijoshi/hire-from-under-represented-groups/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines for contributing.âœ¨
